# Simple Landing Page

This project is a submission for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree (JavaScript part)

## About The Project

This project was mainly focused on the JavaScript part of the application. Most of the styling and HTML code was already there for me by cloning the [Landing Page repo](https://github.com/udacity/cd0428-landing-page/)

## Work done in the project

My main focus was to make the navbar component as user friendly as possible and to provide a good user experience, I also did some work for handling active sections

### Navbar behavior

- It gets a little bit transparent when the user stops scrolling
- transparency is set back to normal when the user scroll out of a certain offset
- Highlights the current active section nav link
